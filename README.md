# visage-97
Visage 97 is a Linux icon pack designed for people who want a retro, pixelated look for their computers.
The pack was inspired by icons and general design aesthetic used in the early 1990s. The goal of this icon pack is to create a coherent theme without directly copying an existing operating system's icons as is. It tries to mix the styles of both Linux and Macintosh styles.
